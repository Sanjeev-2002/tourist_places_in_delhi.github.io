            <h2>India Gate: History</h2>
            <p>This stupendous structure was constructed by the Imperial War Graves Commission aka IWCG, which was
                established
                in 1917 to build war memorials and graves for soldiers who lose their lives in the First World War. The
                memorial
                was designed by a famous English architect by the name Sir Edwin Lutyens and its foundation was laid by
                the Duke
                of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria, on 10 February 1921. After 10 long years, on February 12,
                1931,
                Viceroy Lord Irwin inaugurated and dedicated this structure to the nation and its future generations.
                The names
                of over 13,000 soldiers who lost their lives during the war are also inscribed on the memorial.</p>

            <p>In the honor of soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, a new structure was
                added
                to the India Gate in 1972. Known as Amar Jawan Jyoti (which means the Flame of the Immortal Soldier),
                this was
                inaugurated by Indira Gandhi, who was the then PM of India.</p>
