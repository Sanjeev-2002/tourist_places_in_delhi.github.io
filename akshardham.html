            <h2>Akshardham Temple, Delhi: History</h2>
            <p>Swaminarayan Akshardham came into existence as a result of Shri Yogiji Maharaj’s wish to build a temple
                complex
                in Delhi. He conceived this idea around 1968 when he was serving as the spiritual head of Bochasanwasi
                Shri
                Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, better known as BAPS. However, it was his successor and fifth
                spiritual
                guru in line after Bhagwan Swaminarayan, Pramukh Swami Maharaj who started the construction of the
                temple.
            </p>

            <p>About 60 acres of land was granted by the Delhi Development Authority and 30 acres by the Uttar Pradesh
                Government for the erection of this temple. The construction started in 2000 and was completed within
                five
                years. Standing on the banks of River Yamuna, Akshardham Temple was opened to the public on 6th November
                2005.
                The temple was inaugurated by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the presence of eminent personalities such as Dr.
                A.P.J.
                Abdul Kalam, L.K. Advani, B.L. Joshi, and Dr. Manmohan Singh – the then Prime Minister of India.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest temples in Delhi as well as in India, this spiritual place was constructed by BAPS.
                More
                than
                8000 volunteers participated and 300,000,000 volunteer hours were spent in the construction of this
                temple.
            </p>
